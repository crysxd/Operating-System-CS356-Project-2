##Problem Statements
Your primary goal for this project is to implement and experiment with page replacement algorithms. To do this, you will write a paging simulator. It will read in a set of data files specifying the scheduling and memory access behavior of programs, and will simulate the paging requirements of those programs.
As input, you will receive two types of files: scheduling traces and memory traces.

###1. Scheduling Traces
Scheduling files contain a trace of process start time, CPU time, and I/O count. For the purposes of this project, you will only need to look at start time and CPU time. The format of these files is illustrated below:
The format is:

xlogout 0 8.58 102720  <br>
login.kr 3 1.36 137024  <br>
rm 4 0.03 96 <br>

Program Start time CPU time name (in seconds) (in seconds)
This trace indicates that xlogout started at time 0, required 8.58 CPU seconds to execute, and issued 102,720 I/O operations. The login.kr program started at time 3, required 1.36 CPU seconds to execute, and issued 137,024 I/O operations.
The trace is in order, meaning that each process has a start time later than or equal to the previous start time.

###2. Memory Traces
Memory trace files contain a list of addresses accessed by a program. The addresses are truncated to virtual page numbers by removing the lower 12 bits, which makes the files smaller. Here is an example for PowerPoint program:

0x0012f <br>
0x77f46 <br> 
0x0012f <br>
0x7ffde <br>
0x0012f <br>
0x77f3c <br>
0x0012f <br>
0x7ffde <br>
0x0012f <br>

As an aside, the even numbered addresses (e.g. index 0,2,4) are instruction addresses and the odd numbered addresses (e.g. at index 1,3,5) are data addresses. This accounts for the alternating low values (instructions) and high values (data).
The memory traces are a list of virtual page numbers. This means that the page size does not matter for this project. In addition, you can assume that there is no sharing: the virtual page is private to a process.

###3. Simulating scheduling
You will need to simulate a simple scheduling algorithm that allows programs to alternate running. For this project, you only need implement round robin between runnable processes with fixed time slices. Your simulator should take as input the number of memory references in a time slice, which is called the quantum.
Your scheduler will keep track of the current time in terms of cycles, where a cycle is one memory reference in the memory trace. You will simulate a fairly slow system, where there are 100,000 cycles in a second.
Your scheduler should run (1) when the current quantum expires, to decide whether to context switch the process, and (2) when a process blocks on a page fault (this will be explained below). Context switching should take 50 cycles. After a context switch, you should start simulating memory references from where you left off.
The scheduler should pick the next process to run and then start simulating the memory accesses for that process (see next section). Like a real scheduler, your simulated scheduler must keep track of which process is running, which are ready, and which are blocked.
Your simulator should maintain the current time (e.g., the number of seconds or cycles since the simulation started). A process from the trace should be put in the ready queue (or run) when the current time equals the start time in the scheduling trace file. It executes memory instructions for the CPU time value from the trace file, and then exits when it has used up its CPU time.
The scheduler should report elapsed time (time between when it started and when it completed) for each process. In addition, at the end of the simulation (when all processes have completed), it should report the total number of cycles executed and the number of cycles where no process was executing (i.e., there was nothing runnable).
You should experiment with quanta values of 10,000 cycles, 50,000 cycles, and 200,000 cycles.

###4. Simulating page replacement
Your simulated machine will have a fixed number of physical pages that you must share between the currently running processes. Hence, when the memory required by the running programs
exceeds the available physical memory, you will need to store some of the memory on a disk.
On each cycle, you will simulate the next memory reference in the trace for the running program. When a program starts, you should open the corresponding trace file based on the program name. For example, if the program name is "grep", you should open the "grep" memory trace.
You will simulate this by keeping track of which pages are in physical memory and which are on disk. It takes 1000 cycles to move a page from disk to memory. Moving pages from memory to disk is free, as this can be overlapped with computation. Only one page at a time can be read off disk. For example, if two processes both fault on different pages, you need to wait 1000 cycles for the first page and then 1000 cycles for the second page. You may want to maintain a queue of pending requests for the disk. While a page is moving from disk to memory, you can execute other processes ‐‐ the operation is asynchronous.
For each cycle that process executes, you should check whether the virtual page it accesses is in physical memory. If so, advance to the next address. If it is not in physical memory, you must simulate a page fault by:

1. Context switching to a new process
2. Putting the current process on a blocked queue
3. Reading the page off disk
4. Making the process ready again when the page comes back off disk

You must keep track, for each process, which pages are in physical memory and which are on disk. Assume that all pages start off on disk and you are doing demand paging. Because writing pages to disk is free, you don't have to worry about whether a page is dirty or not (and in fact, the trace does not indicate whether a memory reference is a read or a write).
For each process, you should report the number of page faults it experienced. In addition, when the simulation terminates, you should report the total number of page faults experienced across all processes.
You should experiment with total physical memory sizes of 50 pages, 250 pages, and 1000 pages.

###5. Page replacement policies
You should simulate three different page replacement policies, specified as a command line parameter:

1. FIFO: The first page brought in is the first to be removed.
2. LRU: The least recently accessed page is the one to be removed
3. Second‐chance algorithm:You should maintain a clock hand that rotates around

memory. Each physical page is marked "unused". Each time a page is needed, the hand advances until it finds a page marked "unused", at which time that page is chosen for eviction. If it finds a page marked "used" in this process, the page is changed to be "unused". In addition, on every memory reference, the page accessed should be marked "used".
For the provided scheduling traces, you should try all three page replacement policies to see how
each one performs.

###6. Extra Credit
If you finish this project early, you can earn up to 15% extra credit by trying to invent your own page replacement policy. Wikipedia lists several policies you could try.
The extra credit will be a competition: we will run your extra replacement policy on a set of programs with a medium (not small) amount of memory. The person with the best policy will get up to 15% extra credit, and other guys will receive proportionally less based on his/her rank.

###8. Project Specification
The command line for your simulator should be:
mem‐sim pages quantum pr‐policy trace‐file where
- pages is the number of physical pages
- quantum is the number of cycles in a scheduling quantum
- pr‐policy is one of "fifo", "lru" or "2ch‐alg" and indicates which page replacement policy
to use.
- trace‐file is the name of the scheduling trace file

The output of the simulator should be:
- For each process, the elapsed time it took to run and the number of pages faults it
experienced.
- For the entire simulation, the total elapsed time, the total number of page faults, and the
total idle time.

The simulator should handle these events:
- Memory reference
- Process creation
- Timer interrupt for time slices
- Disk I/O with disk interrupts
- Page faults

The costs of events for the simulation are:
- Memory reference: 1 cycles
- Context switch: 50 cycles
- Read page off disk: 1000 cycles

Other overheads, such as running the scheduler or handling a page fault, need not be considered. The simulator should execute one memory instruction per cycle. Context switches take 50 cycles
during which no memory instructions may be executed. Replacing a page (evicting it from memory) is free, but bringing it back from disk takes 1000 cycles. During this time, other programs may execute.
You should experiment with total physical memory sizes of 50 pages, 500 pages, and 5000 pages. You should experiment with quanta values of 10,000 cycles, 50,000 cycles, and 200,000 cycles.
You should run experiments with FIFO, LRU, and 2nd‐chance algorithm page replacement algorithms.
